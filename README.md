## This is our simple shell project built with the C programming language.

Testing my knowledge on the grab of major C concepts like:

* Unix Operations
* File handling
* Standard libraries
* Memory allocation with malloc and calloc

etc

```c
    int main() {

        printf("Hello Simple Shell");

        return(0);
    }

```
